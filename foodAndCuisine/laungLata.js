<div className='note1'>
<h3>Historical Roots:</h3><br/>

<h3>Ingredients and Preparation:</h3><br/>
Launglata is crafted using a combination of ingredients that showcase the diversity of Bihar's culinary resources. 
The primary components include flour, sugar, ghee (clarified butter), and a unique blend of spices, with a prominent role played by clove (laung), from which the sweet derives its name.<br/>

The preparation process begins with the creation of a dough using flour and ghee.
 Small portions of this dough are then shaped into cylindrical or spherical forms.
 What sets Launglata apart is the infusion of clove, which imparts a subtle spiciness to the sweet, creating a delightful contrast to the sugary goodness.<br/>

Once shaped, these sweet delights are deep-fried to achieve a golden brown exterior, achieving a perfect balance between crispiness and tenderness. 
Finally, the Launglata is coated in sugar syrup, allowing it to absorb the sweetness and ensuring a flavor profile that is both unique and irresistible.<br/>
