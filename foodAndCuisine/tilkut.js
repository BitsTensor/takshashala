<h3>Historical Roots:</h3><br/>
Tilkut's origins trace back through the annals of time, rooted in ancient traditions and rituals.
 Legend has it that Tilkut was offered as a winter treat during the auspicious festival of Makar Sankranti, symbolizing the transition from winter to spring.
  Over the years, this humble sweet evolved from a seasonal specialty to a year-round delight, becoming an integral part of Bihar's cultural and culinary landscape.
  <br/>
<h3>Ingredients and Preparation:</h3><br/>
Tilkut is a marriage of simple yet essential ingredientsâ€”sesame seeds, jaggery, and a touch of ghee (clarified butter).
 The preparation begins with roasting sesame seeds to enhance their nutty flavor.
  The golden-brown seeds are then combined with molten jaggery, creating a sticky yet pliable mixture.
  This amalgamation is skillfully shaped into round discs or squares and left to cool until it solidifies.<br/>

The addition of ghee imparts a subtle richness, balancing the nuttiness of sesame with the sweetness of jaggery. 
The result is a confection that encapsulates the essence of Tilkut, where each bite tells a story of tradition, simplicity, and the joy of indulgence.<br/>
